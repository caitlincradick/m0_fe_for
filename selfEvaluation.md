# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
This was definitely the hardest assignment for me to complete. After getting help from someone in my small group cohort and reviewing it in the last session I have a MUCH better understading of it. I still don't feel fully confident, and less confident than I have with any other concept so far. 
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
It felt overwhelming, especially the way I was trying to pull the information from previous lessons. I was referring to the Mod 0 instructions, my written notes and Google. I don't think I've ever had so many Google tabs open. I did have productive struggle that spiraled into unproductive struggle when it came to researcing. I was trying to do too many things at one time. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I need to practice a lot of the material and grasping the concepts of For Statements. This also taught me a lesson when it comes to overwhelm. I am currently working multiple jobs and am already stretched pretty thin, so I think revising my calendar to be more exact/detailed and scheduling in wellness is going to be very important. 
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I still need to study the syntax and practice more. I will reach out to my cohort again or join a study hall to get these answers.
